# The notebooks I created for exploratory analysis

These are the Jupyter notebooks and their outputs I created to investigate the dataset at the early stage of the project.

* ```cdd_outliers.csv```: The list of grid cells with exceptionally large CDD values I found in the ETCCDI data. Decided to ignore because they were in the middle of the ocean.
* ```exploratory_analysis_etccdi.ipynb```: The notebook where I explored the ETCCDI variables.
* ```exploratory_analysis_wc30as.ipynb```: The notebook where I explored the WorldClim variables.
* ```thesis_visualizations.ipynb```: The file where I created one visualization for the thesis because R packages could not give me the plot I wanted.
* ```wc_future_OOS.csv```: The list of grid cells that are marked as out of scope in the future WorldClim data. I put them in a CSV file so I can check where they were on QGIS.
* ```wc_historical_OOS.csv```: The list of grid cells that are marked as out of scope in the present-day WorldClim data.
