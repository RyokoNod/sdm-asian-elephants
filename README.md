# Predicting the habitat suitability for elephants in 2070

This is the project that corresponds the manuscript authored by Ryoko Noda, Michael F. Mechenich, Juha Saarinen, Aki Vehtari, and Indrė Žliobaitė, submitted to Ecological Informatics and waiting for review. The project uses non-Bayesian and Bayesian species distribution models to find candidate areas for rewilding for Asian elephants (*Elephas Maximus*) that would remain habitable for them until 2070. It originally used to be Ryoko's master thesis project at Aalto University.

The original thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/RyokoNod/sdm-asian-elephants/blob/main/manuscripts/thesis_aalto_2022.pdf) and the article submitted to Ecological Informatics can be found [here](https://github.com/RyokoNod/sdm-asian-elephants/blob/main/manuscripts/manuscript_under_submission.pdf).

## The mind map

I created a mind map that walks you through the outputs of the models I explored within this project (the one shown above). You can access it [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOX_Zhf8=/?share_link_id=937959545296). If the link has somehow expired, you can find a vector image of it in ```images/mind-map.pdf```.

## What you can find in each folder

For the details, please check the README document in the subfolder.

* ```codes```: This folder contains the codes I used for the model and plots and their helper functions.
* ```data```: This folder is for the data used for modeling and the outputs from each model.
* ```data_exploration```: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks I used to explore the data.
* ```images```: The visualizations I created in the project can be found here.
* ```manuscripts```: The final version of the thesis and article I submitted is in this folder.
