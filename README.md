# Predicting the habitat suitability for elephants in 2070

My master thesis project that uses ML and Bayesian species distribution models to find a relocation area for Asian elephants (*Elephas Maximus*) that would remain habitable until 2070. Don't freak out, this is a fictional experiment. I won't be kidnapping and taking elephants anywhere ;)

The written thesis can be found at **<put link here when it's ready>**.

## The mind map

I created a mind map that walks you through the outputs of the models I explored within this project. You can access it at https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOX_Zhf8=/?share_link_id=937959545296. Or if the link has expired and you can't access it anymore, you can find a vector image of it in ```images/mind-map.pdf```.
